# Project 5 - BeReal

Submitted by: Samyak Jain

The BeReal clone project is a two-part project that aims to replicate some of the core features of the BeReal app. Users are prompted to post a photo of their current activity upon receiving a random notification during the day. In this project, Parse server is integrated for login authentication and account creation, and photo data is fetched from the server. Users are able to sign up and login to their account, persist their login credentials, logout, and upload a photo with an optional caption. Additionally, users can view the most recent 10 photos starting from the most recent photo in the feed.
